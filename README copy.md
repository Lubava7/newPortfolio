Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
Run the TypeScript compiler to generate the JavaScript file in the script/js folder:

npx tsc

This will:

Compile script.ts into JavaScript.
Output the compiled file as script/js/script.js.

If you want TypeScript to automatically recompile files when they change, you can use the --watch flag:

npx tsc --watch
